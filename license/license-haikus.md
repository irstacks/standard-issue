> I think that people really use software licenses to express intentions, and don’t really read the details of the licenses. So I think that licenses should be made as simple as possible, so that they don’t disagree with intentions… thus, haiku licensing:

PD: do what you feel like / since the work is abandoned / the law doesn’t care

MIT: take my code with you / and do whatever you want / but please don’t blame me

LGPL: you can copy this / but make modified versions / free in source code form

MPL: like LGPL / except netscape is allowed / to change the license

GPL: if you use this code / you and your children’s children / must make your source free

RIAA: if you touch this file / my lawyers will come kill you / so kindly refrain
